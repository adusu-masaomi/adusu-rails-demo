Bundler::GemNotFound: Your bundle is locked to activesupport (4.2.6), but that version could not be found in any of the sources listed in your Gemfile. If you haven't changed sources, that means the author of activesupport (4.2.6) has removed it. You'll need to update your bundle to a different version of activesupport (4.2.6) that hasn't been removed in order to install.
